<h1>Visualizing Arrival Predictions</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><b>Real-time arrival predictions</b> can improve the usability of transit and <b>provide a better overall experience</b> for the riders. However, this information is generally presented statically. Moreover, if a user wants to find information for a particular stop, they generally have to navigate fairly clunky interfaces, where the information will be presented to them numerically.</p>

<p>Our goal is to provide a one-stop-shop where transit users can <b>infer the next bus arrival</b> information at any stop along a particular route <b>with a single look</b>. Our web application combines the reported position of the buses and the arrival prediction information to color code the route. The following <b>interactive map</b> shows our visualization framework using actual arrival data collected on the <a href="http://pt.berkeley.edu/around/transit/routes">Bear Transit</a> campus shuttle system at <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/index.html">UC Berkeley</a> from 8am to 10am during July 11th, 2013. The time has been speed up "5x" to present a more dynamic animation. <b>Try zooming in and out, dragging around or clicking on a stop</b>.</p>

<h2>How to use it</h2>

<p>You only need to <b>glance at the color surrounding a stop</b> and compare it with bottom right legend to infer the time left until the next bus arrival. To get <b>more accurate information</b>, you just need to <b>click on a particular stop</b> and a window will automatically pop-up. In our example, the window just contains the stop name and the predicted time left until the next arrival in minutes. Other useful information that we could include is: distance between the stop and the next bus to arrive, ammenities surrounding the stop, etc. </p>

<p>Moreover, when a stop is clicked on, a gray circular catchment area appears. The radius of this area is calculated to determine if you could catch the next bus on time. If you happen to be located within the gray shadowed area, you should be able to catch the next bus at the selected stop by just walking to it at a convenient pace. This is the simplest combination of arrival information and geo-fencing that we could think of, but one can envision more interesting applications (e.g. a mobile app where an alarm could be triggered to alert the user that he/she should start walking to get the next bus).</p>
