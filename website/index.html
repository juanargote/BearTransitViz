<h1>Visualizing Arrival Predictions</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><b>Real-time arrival predictions</b> can improve the usability of transit and create a better overall experience for the riders. However, this information is generally presented statically in a maze of unintuitive interfaces. If a user wants the arrival information at a stop, they generally have to navigate to a different interface, where the information will be numerically presented to them.</p>

<p>Our goal is to provide a one-stop-shop where transit users can easily infer the next bus arrival information at any point along a particular route. Our web application combines the reported position of the buses and the arrival prediction information to color code the route based on the time left until the next bus arrives. Therefore, the passenger only needs to glance at the color surrounding her stop in order to infer the time until the next bus arrival. This visualization also includes geo-fencing, to aid in determining which stop to access.</p>
